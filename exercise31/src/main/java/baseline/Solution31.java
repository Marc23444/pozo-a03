    -Create an input method that will take in and validate user input
    -Once input is validated the data is passed through an output function
        -This function will have a while loop that displays the intensity and rate
        -Heart rate will be calculated in a function called calcHR
        -Finally once the HR is calculated it will be displayed in a table

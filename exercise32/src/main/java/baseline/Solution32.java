    -The program starts with a function called difficultyInput
    -Once this function has gotten valid input, it will pass the difficulty level chosen to the function gameLoop
    -Gameloop
        -Will generate a random number based on the difficulty level
        -Will have a while loop that prompts the user for input
        -Will check if the user is right or wrong, will keep track of total guesses
            -The program will provide feedback based on a users preformance
                -If the number guessed was too high the user is told
                -If  the number guessed was too low the user is also told
            -Once the correct number is found the loop will exit
        -Once out of the loop the program will ask the user to play again, this will result in a call to difficultyInput
        and the cycle will continue

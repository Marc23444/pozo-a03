    -The program will have a function called input that will take in user input
        -Input will take the rate of return
    -This input function will then check:
        -That r is > 0
        -That r is a number
    -If either of those conditions are not met the program will prompt for input again
    until the conditions are met.
    -Input will send r to a seperate function called calcYears which will then return
    the years. years will then be output in input
